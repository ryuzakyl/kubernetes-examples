[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) provides full-stack visibility into Kubernetes environments, with:

* out-of-the-box integrations with Kubernetes, Docker, containerd, and all your containerized applications, so you can see all your metrics, logs, and traces in one place

* Autodiscovery so you can seamlessly monitor applications in large-scale dynamic environments

* advanced monitoring features including outlier and anomaly detection, forecasting, and automatic correlation of observability data

In order to install/deploy the different **Datadog** components:
* The Datadog Agent
* The Datadog Cluster Agent
* The node-based Agent
