Kubernetes includes several useful monitoring tools, both as built-in features and cluster add-ons. The available tooling is valuable for spot checks and retrieving metric snapshots, and can even display several minutes of monitoring data in some cases.

For monitoring production environments, you need visibility into your Kubernetes infrastructure as well as your containerized applications themselves, with much longer data retention and lookback times. Using a monitoring service can also give you access to metrics from your Control Plane, providing more insight into your clusterâ€™s health and performance.
