Kubernetes examples for beginners

## Hardware specifications

In case it is relevant for the reader, these are the hardware specifications where all the examples on this repo were tested:

> Linux matrix 5.0.0-32-generic #34~18.04.2-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 10 10:36:02 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

## Setting up Kubernetes

> **TL;DR** To install KinD and create a 3 node (1 control plane and 2 workers) Kubernetes cluster, simply run:
>
> ```console
> $ make kind-install
> $ make create-cluster
> ```

### Choosing a Kubernetes installer

There are several Kubernetes installers for a development environment ([read more](https://www.padok.fr/en/blog/minikube-kubeadm-kind-k3s)). Some of those are:
* Minikube
* Kubeadm
* KinD
* K3S

In these examples the tool chosen to create and configure a Kubernetes cluster was [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

**Why KinD?**

From the KinD home page:
> * kind supports multi-node (including HA) clusters
> * kind supports building Kubernetes release builds from source
> * support for make / bash / docker, or bazel, in addition to pre-published builds
> * kind supports Linux, macOS and Windows
> * kind is a [CNCF certified conformant Kubernetes installer](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=kind).

### Creating the cluster

**Installing KinD**

**KinD** is a single binary that can be executed on Linux, macOS and Windows. We can download it from the [release page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/) of the official **GitHub** [repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) or we can follow the Quick Start [guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start#installation). We'll go with the latter.

> ```console
> $ curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.10.0
> $ chmod +x ./kind
> $ mv ./kind /usr/bin/kind
> ```

**NOTE:** The version used is v0.10.0, the latest one when writing this documentation.

**Creating a Kubernetes cluster**

To create clusters with KinD, we only need to run two commands (the 2nd one is "optional") ([learn more](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start#creating-a-cluster)):
> create cluster --name {{cluster-name}} --config {{config-file-path}}
> kubectl config set-context kind-{{cluster-name}}

**NOTE:** For the examples of this repository, we need an **ingress enabled** KinD cluster. The configuration file for this kind of cluster makes use of two extra arguments ([read more](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/ingress/#create-cluster)):
* **extraPortMappings** allow the local host to make requests to the Ingress controller over ports 80/443
* **node-labels** only allow the ingress controller to run on a specific node(s) matching the label selector

The final confguration file for KinD is at [kind/configs/ingress-enabled-config.yaml](kind/configs/ingress-enabled-config.yaml).

### Interacting with the cluster

From the Quick Start [guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#interacting-with-your-cluster):

> After creating a cluster, you can use kubectl to interact with it by using the configuration file generated by kind.
>
> By default, the cluster access configuration is stored in **${HOME}/.kube/config** if **$KUBECONFIG** environment variable is not set.
>
> If **$KUBECONFIG** environment variable is set, then it is used as a list of paths (normal path delimiting rules for your system). These paths are merged. When a value is modified, it is modified in the file that defines the stanza. When a value is created, it is created in the first file that exists. If no files in the chain exist, then it creates the last file in the list.

**NOTE:** For these examples, the generated **kubeconfig** file was moved to a specific folder and the following entry was added to the *~/.bashrc* file:

> ```console
> $ export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/folder/with/kubeconfig
> ```

## Observability

### Monitoring/Metrics

As the number of cyber attacks rise, itâ€™s important for cloud monitoring services to detect possible breaches, identify security gaps, and secure the network well before an attack happens.
